# testingRMD
Created during October 2019 RMarkdown Workshop at the UVA Claude Moore Health Sciences Library. 
Please note, this is a markdown file, not RMarkdown. It is the repository where I am testing out RMarkdown and GitHub's connection to RStudio. Over in Environment > Git, you will see the testingRMD.Rproj and the blue README.md files. We want to save these changes, clicking all of the files under Git and hitting Commit. A new window will open, and you must write a Commit message describing your changes. This time, write "Update README" and press Commit. Now these changes are only local, so let's put them on GitHub by hitting "Push" at the top right corner. Go to GitHub and refresh to see the changes.
